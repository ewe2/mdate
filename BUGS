Documentation bug with mdate.txt, its missing lines and characters from the
fop conversion for some reason.

There's a GCC or gnu library bug somewhere that gets triggered by
optimizations (or i18n bugs?) for certain languages, de and es.

I fixed es by removing an empty line (big clue) and by lowering the
optimization under linux, that fixed de. But under FreeBSD optimization isn't
a good idea anyway, so de is still hosed. Users of the FreeBSD port are warned
that WANT_PRETTY is NOT a good idea if you intend to use the German language,
unless you like leaving core files around! Any help with this pernicious bug
would be greatly appreciated.

Going back too far with a default @a/@A is asking for trouble. Try:

mdate -c 5848285 -j 584285

it's a mess; even worse try:

mdate -j 584285.0

Previously, you could mdate -c 0 -j 0 but that makes a bigger
mess now. The only fix for this is to NOT make @a/@A default values for now,
but I suspect it's a locale/struct tm problem really and nothing I care to
rewrite for now.
