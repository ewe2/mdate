<abstract>
Mdate is an easy to use command-line utility for conversion between Gregorian
calendar  dates and Mayan calendar dates.
</abstract>

<toc>

<sect>Introduction
<p>
Mdate was written to fill a need: a simple, freely-available program for
non-academic people interested in the Mayan calendar. Except for the Emacs
Mayan calendar mode (which has some severe limitations), this has been lacking
on all popular operating systems, which is odd considering the continuing
public interest in the Mayan civilisation.
<p>
Mdate has been in continuous development for over four years, mostly due to
the limited interest in such a program by programmers, but fortunately not by
users.

<sect1>History
<p>
The current version of Mdate is 1.5.8, written by Sean Dwyer with help from
many others over the years.

The first public version of Mdate was 0.5.0, written in late 1998, and was
also ported to MS-DOS. Craig Robbins contributed to versions 0.5.1 to
1.0.0beta1. Version 1.0.0beta1 (1999) was the first GPL version of Mdate, and
included a Tk interface.

Mdate 1.0.5 was internationalised, and was quickly followed by version 1.1.0,
also the first version at the new sourceforge.net home.

Mdate 1.2.0 was modularised into a library (libmdate) and front-ends for Tk,
command-line and GTK+.

Mdate 1.2.8 was the last libmdate-dependent and frontend-oriented Mdate, by
now suffering from too much setup code and neglect.

Mdate 1.3.0 dropped the libmdate dependence, had a total rewrite in C++/C and
a much simpler build system, although still missing internationalisation
support and needing new front-ends. 

Mdate 1.3.4 added a simple translation layer, following the mplayer method.

Mdate 1.4.0 brought in user date formatting (like <tt>date(1)</tt>), and began
the process of proper internationalization and configuration., still using the
example of mplayer.

The first BeOS port was made in Mdate version 1.4.1.

Mdate 1.4.2 enhanced the language support by making it a runtime choice per an
option.

Mdate 1.4.3 added a mingw32 cross-compiler port and allowed different
language defaults.

Mdate 1.4.5 included a compile-time option to use modern Mayan calendar month
names.

Mdate 1.4.7 introduced the first FreeBSD (4.9-STABLE) port. The
program-parseable flag (-p) was rendered defunct when the parseable output
became the default output format. A new OS X (Mac 32-bit console) port also
became available.

Mdate 1.5.2 switched the VC system over to subversion, with intentions to open
up development with a better multiple developer system.

Mdate 1.5.6 was the first new release of mdate since version 1.5.1 on
sourceforge.net.

Mdate 1.5.7 was the first release on code.google.com

<sect>Usage
<sect1>Options

<sect2>Mayan Calendar Names
<p>
From version 1.4.5, a compile-time option was added for those preferring the
new Romanized Mayan calendar names to the old ones, e.g. Kumk'u (new) for
Cumku (old) and 'Ahaw (new) for Ahau (old). I'm interested in feedback about
this option, and whether it could be a format item in its own right.

<sect2>Language support
<p>
As at version 1.4.5, mdate supports five languages: English, Spanish, German,
French and Polish (en, es, de, fr and pl). A runtime option was added so you
could use a different language. The language support is compiled-in and
currently ignores environment language variables.

Example usage:

<tscreen><verb>
$ mdate -L es

NDJ: 2453168.0 fecha: Fri 11 06 2004  12.19.11.06.03 7 Ak'bal  06 Sots
</verb></tscreen>

The default language is English (en). There is no support for regional
language subsets (eg en_AU). Other languages may be compiled as the default.

<sect2>Output format
<p>
The previous default behaviour of Mdate was to output a formatted printout of
current date information, using the default Lounsbury correlation for today's
date:

<tscreen><verb>
$ mdate

Gregorian Date    : 05-April-2002 (05/04/2002)
Julian Day Number : 2452370.0
Long Count        : 12.19.09.02.05
Tzolkin Date      : 2 Chicchan
Haab Date         : 3 Uayeb
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
However, pretty output formatting is now a compile-time option only, due to
ongoing problems (i.e. bugs) on several platforms.

The old <tt>-p, --parseable</tt> flag is now the default behavior, and outputs
this information in one line, much like <tt>date(1)</tt>. Example:

<tscreen><verb>
$ mdate

JDN: 2452370.0 date:  05  04  2002 12.19.09.02.05  02 Chicchan  03 Uayeb 
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
The parseable flag is now effectively ignored when pretty formatting is not
compiled in.

<sect2>Date Formatting
<p>
You may want to specify your current date in a specific way, using one of
mdate's formatting options. Here is the full list:

<p>
<tscreen><verb>
@a abbreviated weekday name
@A full weekday name
@b abbreviated month name
@B full month name
@d weekday (01..31)
@e weekday without a leading zero
@F ISO format Gregorian date (%Y-%m-%d)
@f ISO format Gregorian date (%Y%m%d)
@h unpadded Haab date
@H padded Haab date
@l Long Count
@M named Gregorian month
@m numbered Gregorian month
@t padded Tzolkin date
@T unpadded Tzolkin date
@y year as decimal 00 to 99
@Y Gregorian year
@n add a newline to the output
@j add a tab to the output
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Like <tt>date(1)</tt>, mdate will format a date when given a `+' option, for
example:

<tscreen><verb>
$ mdate -d '07 09 2003' +'@f @l'

20030907 12.19.10.10.15
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
This was specifically requested for those who like to add a Mayan byline to
emails and web pages. However, mdate has not ever supported time of day
parsing/formatting, so it's not rfc822 compliant! Most formats are merely
passed on to <tt>strftime(3)</tt> where applicable.

<sect2>Correlation Options
<p>
By default, Mdate uses the Lounsbury correlation which is equivalent to the
Julian Day Number 584285. You're not forced to use this if you don't want to.
Here are a couple of options for the correlationally-strict :)
<p>
The <tt>-g, --gmt</tt> option uses the standard Goodman-Martinez-Thompson
correlation (GMT for short). It corresponds to the Julian Day Number 584283.
<p>
If you don't agree with either of the above correlation constants, the <tt>-c,
--correlation[=DOUBLE]</tt> allows you to specify a correlation of your own.
Don't be surprised, however if it doesn't work the way you intended,
especially if you set the Julian Day Number too low (see the <ref id="limits"
name="Limitations"> section to understand why!)

<sect2>Date Input
<p>
You probably want to check a specific date at some point. This can be done in
several different ways, depending on the kind of date you already have.
<p>
The <tt>-d, --dmy[="dd mm [-]yyyy"]</tt> option allows you to specify a
Gregorian date. You can also specify negative (BC) years.

<tscreen><verb>
$ mdate -d '05 04 2002'

JDN: 2452311.0 date: Tues 05 02 2002  12.19.08.17.06 8 Kimi  04 Pax

</verb></tscreen>

<p>
In the same way, the <tt>-j, --julian=[DOUBLE]</tt> option will output the
date with a specified Julian Day Number:

<tscreen><verb>
$ mdate -j 2452370

JDN: 2452370.0 date: Fri 05 04 2002  12.19.09.02.05 2 Chik'chan  03 Wayeb

</verb></tscreen>

Notice that you can leave the decimal part out if you wish.
<p>
Finally, the <tt>-l, --longcount[="nn nn nn nn nn"]</tt> option does the same
thing with a Mayan long count date input:

<tscreen><verb>
$ mdate -l '12 19 09 02 05'

JDN: 2452370.0 date: Fri 05 04 2002  12.19.09.02.05 2 Chik'chan  03 Wayeb

</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>Miscellaneous Options
<p>
The <tt>-h, --help</tt> option gives a simple display of help for Mdate.
<p>
The <tt>-v, -V, --version</tt> option outputs version information for Mdate.

<sect>Limitations
<label id="limits">
<p>
Mdate does not support any dates beyond the beginning of the current epoch
(longcount 0.0.0.0.0) matching with the Julian Day Number correlation,
including Gregorian dates. However, you can have fun with correlations, for
example:

<tscreen><verb>
$ mdate -c 584285 -j 584285 '+@J @d @m @Y @l @h @t'

584285.0 13 08 -3113 00.00.00.00.00 8 Kumk'u  04 'Ahaw
</verb></tscreen>

However, the Mayan date above is meaningless :)
