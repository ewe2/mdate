Thanks to the following coders who have contributed to mdate, past and
present: they made the pursuit of Open Source involvement an abiding joy for
me.

Past:

- Craig Robbins, who helped shape the basis for mdate's logical structure.
- David Starner, who was an effective editor and contributed a great drem()
  replacement.
- Matthias Bauer, the first person to translate mdate into anything (and
  you're welcome to do so again :)
- Marcus Berglund, who was the genesis behind the c++ version.

A special thanks to Ivan Van Laningham, who thought I was crazy to attempt a
C/C++ Mayan date program (his Python version is elegant and more detailed),
but encouraged me to continue.

Present:

- Peter da Silva, who wanted date formatting. I'm slow, but I do get there :)
- Tuvok, the Polish translator, and the only person who noticed the 'February
  bug' after an entire year. And still notices bugs :)
- Quique, the (incredibly fast) Spanish translator and bug-wrangler.

- ahwayakchih (a.k.a Shard), who not only ported mdate to BeOS, but rewrote
  the i18n support to allow runtime configuration, and robust handling. AND
  knows what a pointer is and that strstream thingy.

- François-Xavier, who provided a French translation.

- Vampyr Twilight, who sent in a patch for OS X ports.
