Mdate++ 1.7.0  Copyright(c) 1998-2011 Sean Dwyer <ewe2@users.sourceforge.net>
=============================================================================

Mdate++ is descended from Mdate 1.2.8 rewritten in C++, folding in libmdate
0.0.5, and removing autoconf facilities. It is distributed under the terms of
the GNU General Public License version 2.

This version conforms to the GNU getopt command-line conventions (with help
from gengetopt) and introduces new correlation options. More features will be
added as requested, now that the parser is actually sane.

For those new to the mdate utilities, Mdate++ outputs simple Mayan dates for
casual use or for use by other programs (e.g. mailers and editors). There are
very few freely-available Mayan date programs which concerned me enough to
attempt one.

This release includes run-time language configuration, currently:

English (en is default)
German (de),
French (fr),
Spanish (es)
Polish (pl).

Installation
============

Check the config.h for any defines you may need to change. Please READ the
comments in there, they will help I hope. Basically, if you're running a BSD
with GNU tools, or GNU related system, you can pretty much leave things as
they are. I develop on a Debian testing/unstable x86 system which may be a bit
cutting-edge for some. BeOS users have the luxury of their own port - check
http://mdate.sourceforge.net/ for details. OSX users also have their own port,
+which should be up soon at the same place. A cross-compiled mingw32 port can
be generated from this source.

Makefile User Configuration:

1. Define a default language (DEF_EN by default).
2. Define BINDIR, MANDIR, DOCDIR. This defaults to /usr/bin,
   /usr/share/man/man1, and /usr/share/doc/mdate.

3. If you have a *nix that needs them, define nosnprintf, nogetopt or noi18n.
4. Define pretty if you want an alternate output format rather than standard
   date(1) behaviour
5. Define oldmayan or newmayan according to your taste in Mayan names.


There are also helpful comments in the Makefile if you get lost: just type
make, and make install. Users of previous mdates may like to rename/remove
older versions. There's also plenty of documentation you may wish to install,
try make createdoc, which creates html, text, TeX, dvi, ps and pdf output.
These may or may not work depending on your tools. A manual page, text and
html versions of the documentation are always provided.

If you want to generate your own documentation, you'll need a Docbook
installation, xsltproc, fop and html2text.

It is assumed that you're using GNU C/C++ and GNU Make; unfortunately I have
no access to different OS's and architectures. You are encouraged to add a
target or defines so that others might benefit and enjoy Mdate.


Suggested Usage
===============

Something nice and terse for an email line might be:

mdate -d '10 09 2003' '+@l @t @h'
which gives you:

12.19.10.10.08 05 Lamat 16 Mol

For help in your chosen language try:

mdate -L <your language> -h

A nice format for the current date could be:

mdate '+@A @B @d @l'

note this won't work for past or future dates.
