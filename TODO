For 1.7.x:

implement a config file, for parameters such as correlation and Julian
Calendar > Gregorian Calendar changeover. Rewrite parsing code to use
libboost-program-options to implement commandine and config-file.

implement jdn <-> julian dates. if possible, integrate into jdn<-> gregdates.

implement CR and other calculations.

For 1.6.x:

alter development to release+patch branch and unstable branch, to manage
implementation changes and release on github.

General:

Ports:

Re-port to freeBSD, which has some challenges.  For example, unicode is basically
absent in 4.x-6.2, which is a problem for translation files which have to be
in utf-8. I don't have a working freeBSD system. other considerations are the
available tools (esp. for documentation) and filesystem conventions.

Someone called Eric has ported 1.5.6 to the latest OSX (Snow Leopard) but
hasn't got back to me about his binary. I no longer have a working OSX
enviroment to port.

plan9 port? it doesn't have a c++ dialect and may resist.

irix port (i have an o2) but i doubt if there is any interest.

Distros:

mdate.spec is badly out of date and doesn't build on my Debian system at
present. should try and fix it.

Documentation:

write something q&d to update 1.5.x versions across source files:
README
NEWS
mdate.xml
Makefile (also requires change to mdate-1-5-x)
mdate.1

Code:

change our correlation possibilities to GMT1 (standard GMT),GMT2,GMT3(Lounsbury) 
http://www.members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/corr.html : perhaps a -gmt(1|2|3) option
instead.

Ignore this line, its a test.
