For 1.7.x:

implement a config file, for parameters such as correlation and Julian
Calendar > Gregorian Calendar changeover. Rewrite parsing code to use
libboost-program-options to implement commandine and config-file.

implement jdn <-> julian dates. if possible, integrate into jdn<-> gregdates.

implement CR and other calculations.

implement unit testing for correlation/option processing bugs. boost should be
able to catch much of this.

look to replace dependency on c-only functions particularly snprintf and type
conversion functions.

For 1.6.x:

alter development to release+patch branch and unstable branch, to manage
implementation changes and release on github.

General:

Ports:

Re-port to freeBSD, which has some challenges.  For example, unicode is basically
absent in 4.x-6.2, which is a problem for translation files which have to be
in utf-8. I don't have a working freeBSD system. other considerations are the
available tools (esp. for documentation) and filesystem conventions. Get a
freeBSD in the new 7.x series and work from that, if mdate is in ports contact
maintainer.

Re-port to mingw32 using boost, which may require Windows-specific alteration
(particularly config file usage).

Someone called Eric has ported 1.5.6 to the latest OSX (Snow Leopard) but
hasn't got back to me about his binary. I no longer have a working OSX
enviroment to port.

plan9 port? it doesn't have a c++ dialect and may resist.

irix port (i have an o2) but i doubt if there is any interest.

Distros:

mdate.spec is badly out of date and doesn't build on my Debian system at
present. Should try and fix it - a user has contributed a simple working spec
for his system.

Documentation:

use asciidoc, see git documentation makefile for howto.

Code:

see above.

Ignore this line, its a test.
